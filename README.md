Restrospective Analysis along with another game can be found here: https://medium.com/@ryannealewallace/achieving-abstraction-in-code-12e4b9836108

In Summary:
- Code is too abstracted, too many moving parts.
- Too many moving parts not centralised by managers.
- Order of operations can't be easily controlled due to the spread out nature of the code.
- Simplification of codebase needed for cohesiveness and ease of modification.
- Names of methods and classes too vague, and too difficult to understand.
