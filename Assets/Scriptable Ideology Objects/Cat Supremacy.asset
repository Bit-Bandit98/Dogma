  Details:
    Name: Cat Supremacy
    Description: "In ancient Egypt, cats were believed to be the most special in
      the animal kingdom. Egyptians believed that cats brough good fortune to whomever
      housed them. As a result, Egyptian art contained statues and paintings of the
      felines themselves.\r\nToday, cats are still loved by humans, so much so that
      a whole phenomena of posting cats on the internet has gained popularity. Cats
      are unlikely to lose popularity, and will continue to befriend humanity for
      times to come.\r"
