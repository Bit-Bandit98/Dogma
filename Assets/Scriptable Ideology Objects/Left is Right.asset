  Details:
    Name: Left is Right
    Description: "It can be difficult to gauge how many left handers exist today,
      but it can be deduced that they make up 10-20% of the world population (as
      of 2021), thus being a minority.\r\nLeft handers - solely because they are
      left handed - were often shunned by society, and were thought to be agents
      of Satan himself. This phenomena can be found from the Middle ages, where left
      handers were suspected of being witches. Particular items today often have
      a right hand bias, leading to awkward use of them by left handed people.\r"
