  Details:
    Name: Dog Supremacy
    Description: "Dogs due to their long loyalty towards humans are thought to be
      \u201CMan\u2019s best friend\u201D. It\u2019s not hard to see why, as one of
      the major characteristics that separate dogs from others is their sense of
      loyalty. This loyalty to humans has gone so far as to create many tales of
      love and despair. Famous tales include Hachik\u014D in Japan, and Fido from
      Italy.\r\nDogs will continue to accompany humanity\u2019s advancement through
      history, all while being \u201CMan\u2019s best friend\u201D.\r"
  AbilityText: When discovering a country, its neighbours are also discovered.
