    Description: "Kangaroos - indigenous to Australia and New Guinea - are one of
      the national animals of Australia (another being Emus).  As such, Kangaroos
      are subject to jokes primarily from non-Australian individuals. One such joke
      is the idea that Australians \u201Cride kangaroos to school\u201D. If you want
      an Australian to roll their eyes, ask them this question. One of the reasons
      for this joke is the fact that female Kangaroos have pouches to house their
      young (colloquially called a Joey). \r\nKangaroos are an Australian icon, due
      to them not being found in any other place in the world, and their place in
      Australian\u2019s national identity.\r\n"
