    Description: "The famous Cuban cigar is one of Cuba\u2019s leading exports as
      of 2021, so much so that they accounted for half a billion dollars in 2017
      in revenue for the Cuban Government. Such a cigar sees demand from all over
      the world, even prompting tourists to go to Cuba. Even before the United States
      declared its damaging trade embargo to Cuba, John F. Kennedy ordered 1200 Cuban
      cigars, for what purpose is unknown."
